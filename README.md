# School_District_Analysis

**_School District Analysis Challenge Analysis_**

**Overview of the Project*

Overall, the main goal of the project was to assess several different schools districts and analyze student population, how many of them passed math or reading, as well as pass academics overall. These produced viable results through the use of Python language in Jupyter Notebook: however, there has been potential evidence of academic dishontesty in the data, particularly in Thomas High School. As such, this project aimed to reperform the data analysis by first weeding out the scores of Thomas High School and then repeating the data analysis once more. 

**Results**
- The district summary is affected in that the average math score decreased slightly, by 0.1. The percentage of students who passed math decreased by 0.2%, the percentage who passed reading decreased by 0.3%, and the overall percentage of students who passed decreased notably by 15.1%
- The school summary changes in that Thomas High School's position in terms of students who passed overall drops substantially from 95% to 65%, and the average scores for math and reading as well as percentage of students who passed both have decreased significantly as well. 
- Replacing the 9th graders' scores has an overall negative effect on Thomas High's performance relative to other schools, and drops it lower in the rankings overall.
- Thomas High's average math and reading scores by grade were not affected, barring an absence of scores for the 9th grade.
- As Thomas High School's passing percentages dropped, this would apply to the overall passing percentage of schools that had $630 to $645 spent as investment as an overall decrease in percentage of students who passed.
- The percentage of students who passed math and reading saw slight drops for those in the medium (1000-2000) sized schools. The percentage of those who passed also decreased slightly.
- The percentage of students who passed overall in charter schools decreased by 7%, the rest of the values remained unaffected.

**Summary**

Overall, with this specific assessment, by removing Thomas High's 9th Grade students from the calculations, Thomas High's overall passing scores as well as passing percentages for math and reading students decreased. The average math score and reading score for Thomas High School also saw decreases as well. The average percentage of passing students for schools that had a budget of $630 to $645 also decreased. The percentage of passing students in medium sized schools of 1000-2000 students dropped as well. The percentage of students who passed overall in charter schools decreased.
